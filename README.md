# Crop-Prediction-using-ml-
# Crop Prediction Based on Temperature and Local Conditions

## Overview
This project aims to predict suitable crops for cultivation based on local environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil properties, and other relevant factors. By leveraging data science and machine learning, this system helps farmers make informed decisions to optimize yield and sustainability.

## Features
- **Dataset Analysis:** Preprocesses and visualizes environmental data.
- **Prediction Model:** Recommends crops based on input conditions.
- **Scalable Solution:** Can be extended to include additional environmental factors.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Techniques (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
